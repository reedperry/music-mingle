# Riffbin

The goal is to make Riffbin into a place to easily create or jot down melody/riff ideas with a simple sequencer view, and allow some extra controls over the synth sound parameters. Beyond that, I'd like to allow public/private storage, and live multiplayer for collaboration. Multiplayer may be more useful if the application allows playing and editing multiple sequences at once, but I also want to stay far away from building a DAW. Riffbin should be easy to open up on a mobile device and get an idea out of your head, or listen to/play with your friend's riff.

Using Tone.js and Remix.

## Development

From your terminal:

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

Then run the app in production mode:
